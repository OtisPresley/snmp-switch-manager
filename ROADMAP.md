- ✅ Unified port information pop-up across panel and list views  
  - Displays Admin / Oper status, Speed, VLAN ID, and interface index

- ✅ Theme-safe card styling  
  - All colors now derive from Home Assistant theme variables (Light/Dark compatible)

- ✅ Diagnostics panel improvements  
  - Removed hostname prefix from Diagnostics sensor display names  
  - Optional ability to hide the Diagnostics panel entirely (no reserved space)

- ✅ Virtual Interfaces display controls  
  - Optional ability to hide the Virtual Interfaces panel entirely (no reserved space)

- ✅ Custom switch front-panel visualization  
  - Support for a custom background image in panel view  
  - Adjustable port positioning, offsets, and scaling  
  - Optional per-port coordinate overrides

## 📝 Planned

### 📶 Bandwidth Sensors  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Target Release:** v0.4.0  
**Tracking:** [`#roadmap-bandwidth-sensors`](./CHANGELOG.md#roadmap-bandwidth-sensors)

Add real-time and cumulative traffic visibility for every network interface.

#### Planned Capabilities
- ⬆️ **Total Transmit (TX) Bandwidth**  
  - Cumulative bytes sent per interface  
- ⬇️ **Total Receive (RX) Bandwidth**  
  - Cumulative bytes received per interface  
- ⚡ **Live Throughput (bps)**  
  - Real-time transmit and receive speeds in bits per second  

#### Design Goals
- ✅ Works across **all supported platforms**
  - Cisco SG / CBS  
  - Arista  
  - Juniper (EX series)  
  - OPNsense / pfSense  
- ✅ Uses **high-capacity 64-bit counters** where available (`ifHCInOctets`, `ifHCOutOctets`)
- ✅ **Automatic 32-bit counter wrap detection & correction**
- ✅ **Efficient polling** via the existing coordinator (no per-entity SNMP sessions)
- ✅ **Minimal Home Assistant performance impact**
- ✅ Default exposure as **dedicated diagnostic sensors**

### 🌡️ Switch Environmentals & CPU / Memory Usage  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Target Release:** v0.4.0  
**Tracking:** [`#roadmap-switch-environmentals`](./CHANGELOG.md#roadmap-switch-environmentals)

Add environmental monitoring and system performance telemetry for supported switches and routers.

#### Planned Capabilities
- 🌡️ **Temperature Monitoring**  
  - CPU, PSU, and chassis temperature sensors (when available via SNMP)  
- 🧠 **CPU Utilization**  
  - Current system CPU usage percentage  
- 💾 **Memory Utilization**  
  - Current system memory usage percentage  

#### Design Goals
- ✅ Works across **all supported platforms**
  - Cisco SG / CBS  
  - Arista  
  - Juniper (EX series)  
  - OPNsense / pfSense  
- ✅ Uses **standard SNMP environmental and performance OIDs**
- ✅ **Automatic unit handling**
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit conversion where applicable  
- ✅ **Efficient polling** via the existing coordinator
- ✅ **Minimal Home Assistant performance impact**
- ✅ Default exposure as **dedicated sensor entities**

#### Immediate Capabilities Enabled by This Feature
- 📈 **Historical temperature and utilization graphs** (via Home Assistant statistics)
- 🚨 **Temperature & performance alerting** via automations
- 📊 **Live environmental and system load display** in the Switch Manager UI

### ⚡ Power over Ethernet (PoE) Statistics  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Target Release:** v0.4.0  
**Tracking:** [`#roadmap-poe-statistics`](./CHANGELOG.md#roadmap-poe-statistics)

Add real-time **PoE power usage, status, and budget monitoring** for supported PoE-capable switches.

#### Planned Capabilities
- ⚡ **Per-Port Power Usage (Watts)**  
  - Real-time PoE draw per interface  
- 🔌 **Per-Port PoE Status**  
  - Enabled / Disabled / Fault state  
- 🧮 **Total PoE Budget Usage**  
  - Overall switch PoE utilization percentage
